*S12 - T01 : Advanced machine learning: pipelines, gridsearch and textmining *


Performance a Pipelines, gridsearch and text mining. Let's start with several basic exercises.

Scikit-learn pipelines are a tool to simplify the preprecessing steps such as feature extraction, feature scaling, and dimensionality reduction. Here we are going to learn how the pipelines work and how to implement them. In addition, we will also learn about text mining (also known as text analysis), is the process of transforming unstructured text into structured data for easy analysis

Objectives:
 +  Use pipelines and grid search
 + Perform text mining
